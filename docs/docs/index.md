**Go implementation of Polkadot/Substrate compatible runtimes**

The following project is based on [**previous research**](https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble-research), funded by
[**Web3 Foundation**](https://web3.foundation) **Grants**, and developed and maintained by [**LimeChain
**](https://limechain.tech). The research provides conclusions if _Go_ is a suitable choice for writing Polkadot
Runtimes and further aids the development of a _Go_ toolchain, capable of producing compatible runtimes.

While there are several implementations of Polkadot Hosts in [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate),
[C++](https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome), and [Go](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer), the only option for writing
Polkadot Runtimes is in [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate). Writing Polkadot Runtimes in _Go_ is exciting,
mainly because of _Go_'s simplicity and automatic memory management. It is a modern, powerful, and fast language, backed
by Google and used in many of their software, thus making it an ideal candidate for implementing Polkadot Runtimes.
